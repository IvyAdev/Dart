# Dart Week One

This project contains Dart programs that demonstrate key programming concepts covered in Week One of learning Dart:

Topics Covered

- Variable Declarations 
  - `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, and `List`
  
- Type Conversion
  - Convert between `String`, `int`, and `double`

- Functions
  - `convertAndDisplay()` for type conversion and printing results

- Control Flow
  - If-else statements for:
    - Checking if a number is positive, negative, or zero
    - Voting eligibility based on age
  - `switch` statement to display days of the week
  - Loops:
    - `for` loop (1 to 10)
    - `while` loop (10 to 1)
    - `do-while` loop (1 to 5)

- Combined Logic
  - Iterate over a list of numbers
  - Check if each number is even/odd
  - Categorize numbers as `small`, `medium`, or `large` using `switch`

 How to Run

1. Copy the code from `main.dart`.
2. Paste and run it on [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev), or
3. If Dart is installed locally:
   ```bash
   dart run main.dart
